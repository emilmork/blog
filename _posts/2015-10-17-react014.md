summary:    New syntax for stateless components in React 0.14
categories: javascript react
---

React 0.14 brings several new features, including a new syntax for writing stateless components. Instead of writing a component as a "class", you can now simply use a function with props as argument.

```javascript
// The normal way of creating a React component
const Title = React.createClass({
    render() {
      return <h2>{this.props.title}</h2>
    }
});
ReactDOM.render(<Title />, el);
```
We love the way react gives us a simple workflow by creating declarative components, but the new syntax makes it possible to create our components with pure functions. This makes it even cleaner:

```javascript
// New possible syntax

const Title = (props) => <h2>{props.title}</h2>
// or with destructuring
const Title = ({title}) => <h2>{title}</h2>



ReactDOM.render(<Title />, el);
```
